# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a team project repository with a focus on collaborative development using AI assistance. The repository includes Korean-language logging systems to track development progress and maintain communication between team members and AI assistants.

## Project Logging System

The repository uses three mandatory log files located in the `logs/` directory:

1. **dev_log.md** (개발일지): Documents problems being solved, design intentions, and progress status
2. **prompt_log.md** (프롬프트일지): Records commands/prompts given to AI assistants and their feedback/results
3. **output_review.md** (결과값 검토): Tracks generated code/features, functionality verification, and alignment with project requirements

When working on this project:
- Update the appropriate log files when making significant changes or decisions
- Use the YYYY-MM-DD date format for log entries
- Document design rationale in dev_log.md
- Record AI interactions in prompt_log.md for team transparency
- Review outputs against requirements in output_review.md

## Development Workflow

This repository follows a structured workflow:
1. Document the problem and design intent in dev_log.md
2. Record prompts/commands used in prompt_log.md
3. After implementation, verify the output in output_review.md
4. Check: Does it work? Does it match the requirements? What needs improvement?
